# The following functions are all intended to check whether a string contains
# any lowercase letters, but at least some of them are wrong. For each
# function, describe (is the docstring) what the function actually does.
# You can assume that the parameter is a string.

# Do not merely paste the output as a counterexample into the documentation
# string, explain what is wrong.
